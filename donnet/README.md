This Sample is used to demonstrate the performance impact on the queries using index and without index.

Two samples are available.

1) "SampleQueryPerformanceV2" will be using CosmosDB v2 SDK
2) "SampleQueryPerformanceV3" will be using CosmosDB v3 SDK

Each sample will execute the same query on two collections, with index and without required indexing. 

## Execute the Sample
1) Download the entire solution in [SampleQueryPerformance](https://github.com/simodumu/CosmosDB-Samples/tree/main/donnet/SampleQueryPerformance)
2) Update the Sample with relevant CosmosDB account details. 
Search for "TODO" in the code samples and make relevant changes.
